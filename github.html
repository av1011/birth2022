     Dear my lovely wifeeyyyy,
    </span>

    <p id="message">
      Love of my life:

      Although in any case, I plan to give you an affectionate greeting when I see you, I wanted to advance my words and go on wishing you a very happy birthday from now on, my love.
      
      I may forget some important dates of the year, but I would never forget this because it is the day that God allowed you to come to this world. Thanks to a day like this, I can smile so much because you are the source of all my joy.
      
      You are my dream come true, and you are the one who compliments my life and who motivates me to keep going. You renew my hopes and my strength every time I decline, and you make the good times end up being perfect.
      
      Today on your birthday, I would like to give you my life, which is the most valuable thing I can offer you, but I cannot because I already gave it to you the day I met you.
      
      Of the man who loves you madly and forever </p>
    <p id="inside-sender">
      Love, <br>
      Your Husbannddyyyy
