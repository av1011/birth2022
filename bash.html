		 	My Life,
		 	<br>I know that it is impossible to express everything that my heart and soul feel for you in a few lines. Still, I wanted to give you this detail because I want it to be engraved not only in your memory but also on a paper that you treasure and that you can read every time. Wish. Happy birthday, my life.

			 There is no day when this beautiful and wonderful thing that I feel for you stops growing. You feed it every day with your looks, your smiles, your kisses, and all your signs of true love that you have with me.
			 
			 I also want to tell you that I will never tire of thanking you for changing my life with your love. You arrived, and everything turned a brighter color. I learned what it means to love with you, and I know that what we have will never end.
			 
			 I wish with all the strength of my heart that you are very happy all your life, especially today that you are celebrating.
			 
			 And so you can see that it is truly my greatest wish, I will see to it that you have the best birthday of your life.
		</br>
		 	Abott
